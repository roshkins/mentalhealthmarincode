# Introduction
This is a small app that I made to practice my Redux and React skills. The idea was to begin organizing services for my county.
# To start development server and client:
`Start-Process npm start -WorkingDirectory ".\mentalhealthmarin\"; Start-Process np
m start -WorkingDirectory ".\mentalhealthmarinclient\"`
